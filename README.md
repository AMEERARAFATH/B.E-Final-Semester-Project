        Road safety is a critical issue, and speeding has become a leading cause of accidents in recent years. To combat this problem, a proposed system that combines a Python-based speed limit detection system and an Arduino-based motor speed regulation system offers a potential solution. The proposed system aims to regulate the speed of a motor based on the speed limit of the area in which it is being used, using machine learning algorithms and microcontrollers. The speed limit detection system is built on Python, a popular and versatile programming language. The system uses machine learning algorithms to detect and classify speed limit signs, making it possible to regulate the speed of a motor based on the speed limit of the area. The system can detect and classify different types of speed limit signs, including those indicating changes in speed limit, such as variable speed limit signs. This ensures that the motor's speed is adjusted according to the latest speed limit information available, providing an efficient solution to the problem of speeding. The motor speed regulation system uses an Arduino microcontroller to regulate the motor's speed based on the speed limit. The system can be easily implemented on different types of motors and is adaptable to various settings, including personal vehicles, public transportation, and industrial machinery. The proposed system's versatility also makes it extendable to include other features, such as automatic braking systems and collision detection systems. These additional features could further improve road safety by providing an automatic response to potential collisions. Overall, the proposed system has the potential to significantly improve road safety and reduce the number of accidents caused by speeding. Its cost-effectiveness, versatility, and scalability make it a viable solution for regulating speed limits in various settings. By combining machine learning algorithms and microcontrollers, the system provides an efficient and effective solution to the problem of speeding, offering a promising prospect for safer roads.
